# CrispyTrackerDeluxe

# A redo of the original crispytracker

Originally I had written crispytracker in a subpar manner in terms of code readability, maintainability and the merging of back and front end.

This rework aims to remedy these mistakes and make an overall better tracker to work with.

# What can this tracker do?

SNES based tracker, intended for game development:
- 8 channels of music playback
- 3 SFX channels
- SNES compatibl export
- Subtune system

# Where do I look for more info?
Look into the docs section in asm/DriverV3/docs, this contains some HTML files that should have the proper information for both the programmer and the composer. [as of writing only the programmer document is finished]
